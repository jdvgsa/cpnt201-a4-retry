Code Journal

This is my 4th attempt at completing CPNT201-A4.

- Created a new Vanilla Vite Project with "npm create vite@latest 201-a4"
- Chose Vanilla option from all choices (vue, svelte, etc)
- Wrote command "npm install dayjs" in terminal.
- Wrote "npm config set init-author-name 'John Dagsa'"
- Wrote "npm config set init-license 'MIT'"
- Moved SVG, CSS and JS files into the appropriate folders.
- Created 201-a4 branch and did all attempts of the assignment in branch.
- Pulled and Merged changes from GitHub.
- (Used git checkout -b 201-a4 and git pull / git merge commands to accomplish this task)
- Tried to deploy site to Netlify [https://cpnt201-a4retry.netlify.app]

My final attempts at trying go complete the assignment, I could not figure this out.
