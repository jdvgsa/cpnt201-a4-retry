Code Journal

This is my 4th attempt at completing CPNT201-A4.

Created a new Vanilla Vite Project with "npm create vite@latest 201-a4"
Chose Vanilla option from all choices (vue, svelte, etc)
Wrote command "npm install dayjs" in terminal.
Wrote "npm config set init-author-name 'John Dagsa'"
Wrote "npm config set init-license 'MIT'"
Moved SVG, CSS and JS files into the appropriate folders.
Created 201-a4 branch and did all attempts of the assignment in branch.
Pulled and Merged changes from GitHub.
(Used git checkout -b 201-a4 and git pull / git merge commands to accomplish this task)
Tried to deploy site to Netlify [https://cpnt201-a4retry.netlify.app]

I was planning to not submit anything as I could not figure out how to complete this assignment no matter how many times I reread the instructions but I figured any grade is better than a 0, I was also not comfortable at the idea of submitting nothing as I have never missed an assignment for this class.
I apologize for handing this in late. I have multiple Repo's and I have multiple local attempts saved in my PC.
